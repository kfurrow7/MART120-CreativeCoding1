            My name is Kendall Furrow and I've always had a passion for photography. There is something so special, so endearing about capturing those once-in-a-lifetime kind of moments. I love to seek out those intimate and joyful moments, capturing the essence of every couple’s very special day on camera. I am such a people person as I grew up in a big family along with being a part of the soccer team at the University of Montana. So I love to focus on exclusively making memories for couples and I love getting to know the people that my team and I work with! It is the added personal touch that allows us to photograph truly beautiful and unique moments that reflect your very special day.

            <div>
                As an experienced Wedding Photography , I have photographed a wide variety of events and have a team of highly trained professionals. The perfect day begins with you; your originality, taste, and style inspire everything we do. My parents showed me what the  perfect love story looks like which is what inspires me to help you illustrate your love story through our lenses, providing you with a collection of images that look and feel as authentic as your love.
