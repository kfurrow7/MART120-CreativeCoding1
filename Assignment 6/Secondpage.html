    <body style="background-color: tan;">
    I was born and raised in Fort Collins, Colorado and have two sisters, one brother, along with three dogs. I am a junior and play soccer here at the University of Montana. My major is media arts with a minor in business. Although I am not quite sure what my future holds, I will say that I am excited to see where my career goes especially since technology is growing everyday. I am also hoping to live in various places in my life, just for the experience, but settling down in Colorado wouldn't be too bad since it is beautiful there along with being close to my family. I also a project that I had for school that I really enjoyed working on was creating an advertisment through a mood board. The class was given a resort in the mountains that we had to create a mood of coziness, romance, and adventure through this mood board. Although the task was simple, I really enjoyed being creative and putting it all together. Below you will see two pictures. The first will be my family because they are the most important people in my life. The next will be a picture of my mood board.
